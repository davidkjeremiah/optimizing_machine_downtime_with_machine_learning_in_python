# Project Title

Optimizing Machine Downtime with Machine Learning in Python

This project aims to reduce machine downtime and maintenance cost by implementing a predictive maintenance program using machine learning algorithms. The maintenance data provided contains information such as machine ID, repair cost, repair time, previous repairs, and downtime, which will be used to train and evaluate the model.

## Data
The maintenance data contain the following features:

* `machine_id:` A unique identifier for each machine.
* `repair_time:` The time spent on the repair, in hours.
* `repair_cost:` The cost of the repair, in naira.
* `previous_repairs:` The number of previous repairs on the machine.
* `downtime:` The number of hours that the machine was down due to a maintenance event (such as Replacing worn or damaged parts, Lubricating moving parts, Cleaning and inspecting the machine, Adjusting or calibrating the machine, Upgrading or installing new software or hardware, Testing and verifying the machine's performance, Conducting routine maintenance or preventative maintenance, Repairing or fixing problems or issues with the machine, Performing safety inspections etc.)

## Project Requirements

* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Data Preparation

* The provided `maintenance_data.txt` file needs to be loaded and cleaned.
* Perform any necessary preprocessing of the data, such as handling missing values or normalizing the features.

## Model Training and Evaluation

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Select and train an appropriate machine learning model using the trainig data.
* Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data.
* Optimize the model's hyperparameters for improved performance.

## Predictions and Maintenance Cost Reduction

* Use the trained model to make predictions on new data, such as future repair costs and downtimes.
* Calculate the reduction in maintenance costs based on the predictions.
* Compare the results with the current maintenance costs to determine the potential savings.

## Visualization and Reporting

* Use visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to plot the data and model results.
* Prepare a report summarizing the findings and recommendations for the management team.

## Deployment

* Deploy the trained model as an API or integrate it into a production system, depending on the business requirement.
* Continously monitoring the system performance and retrain the model as necessary with the new data.

## Note

* Please install all the necessary libraries before running the project.
* The provided data is for educational purposes and is only a sample. A real-world data might differ.
* It is good to implement data validation step in the process.
